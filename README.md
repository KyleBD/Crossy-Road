# Crossy-Road

Developed a Crossy Road replica on the Altera DE1-SoC board. The project is completely written in verilog and it leverages input from a PS2 keyboard allowing the user to move the player up and down. The output is then sent to a 160x120 VGA display. All player animations are read from non registered ROM in the datapath before being outputted to the VGA display.
